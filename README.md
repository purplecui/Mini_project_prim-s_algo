# Mini_project_prim-s_algo
Mini project by GAURAV KHADKA

Project no. #15

For implementation of PRIM'S algorithm for finding minimum spanning tree.
Implemented using two ways:
  1. Using adjacency matrix where matrix of the graph is provided
  2. Using adjacency list (functions from lab4 updated for prim's model)
